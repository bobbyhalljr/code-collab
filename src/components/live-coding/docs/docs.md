User Flow Implementation:
Host Creates a Live Coding Session:
The host navigates to the live coding section, selects a challenge, and initiates a live coding session.
The LiveCodingSessionPage component is rendered for the host.
Joining a Live Coding Session:
Participants navigate to the live coding section, see a list of available sessions, and join a selected session.
They enter the LiveCodingSessionPage component with real-time updates.
Ending a Live Coding Session:
The host can end the session using the SessionSettings component.
Participants can leave the session, or the host can forcefully end it.
Styling and UX:
Use a responsive layout for both desktop and mobile.
Implement a clean and intuitive design for the code editor, chatroom, and video chat.
Add features such as code highlighting, syntax suggestions, and chat notifications.
Please note that the implementation details, especially for real-time features, would depend on the technologies you choose, such as WebSocket for real-time communication. Additionally, incorporating video chat might involve using a third-party library or API for video conferencing.
